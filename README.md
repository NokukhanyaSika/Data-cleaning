# Data-cleaning

Performed data cleaning and preprocessing to improve dataset accuracy and consistency. Standardized the "country" column by converting text to lowercase, removing whitespace, and consolidating values into three distinct categories. Enhanced data usability by eliminating inconsistencies, ensuring reliable analysis and reporting. Transformed date information by creating a new "days_ago" column, converting date entries into numerical values for easier time-based analysis.
